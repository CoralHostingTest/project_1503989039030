This project is a typical parsec-based project, based on [apex/api](https://git.corp.yahoo.com/apex/api) with most source code removed for demonstration purpose.


This example shows how Apex handles:

1. parsec-based projects
1. projects with default RDL and document source directory
1. projects with multi-level layout
1. projects using reserved keywords
1. inter-doc linking between auxiliary documents and RDL generated specs.


# ProstoreEWS

* [docs](http://yo/apexExample300)

This sample project demonstrates how to setup and configure a non-parsec-based project for Apex. This project is based on [Prostore_ews_component](https://git.corp.yahoo.com/ProStore/prostore_subsystem_ews_component) with most code removed for demonstration purpose. 

This example shows how Apex handles:

1. non-parsec-based projects
1. projects using reserved keywords
1. projects with non-default document source directory


# MobilePayment

* [source](https://git.corp.yahoo.com/ApexExamples/MobilePayment)
* [docs](http://yo/apexExample308)

This is another example for parsec-based project. It is based on [ec-payment/ec_mobile_payment_ws](https://git.corp.yahoo.com/ec-payment/ec_mobile_payment_ws) with most code removed for demonstration purpose.

This example shows how Apex handles:

1. projects with multiple RDL files
1. projects with non-default RDL source directory
1. projects with no docs directory
1. projects with no `index.md` file. (Apex will create one for you, but you should really write one.)
