* The website will support 
    * Centralized document repository
        * **API Specification:** The description of API end points, request parameters, fields and  responses are essential parts of a good web service documentation.  However excellent API documentation should provide more than that. 
        * **Auxiliary Documents**: Excellent API documentation should include overview, getting started guide, best practices, tutorials, etc. that help with using the API effectively.
        * Apex provides a standard way to configure, generate gorgeous API documentation and host them on the centralized doc repository.
    * Search
        * Search the content of the api documentation
    * Summary page showing analytics for all APIs
    * Real-time analytics for each API
    * Ad-hoc testing
        * Mock Server: the developer can submit a URL and see fake results
        * Test Server: when available, the developer can submit a URL to the test server and see more realistic results.

* All new services should be developed in Java and use the Parsec container which will have all the API libraries.
